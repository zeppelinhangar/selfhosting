# Introduction

~~So you got bored with waiting for ZepMail?~~

So you've decided to get custom branding for Zeppelin?

# Recommended prerequisites
Before attempting to self-host Zeppelin, you should have basic experience with

- Webservers
- Linux
- NodeJS
- Git

Not only will this make the setup process easier, but it will also allow you to diagnose any issues you may run into in the future

# Operating Systems
The only guide we provide is for **[Linux](./guides/operating-systems/ubuntu-18.md)**, and you will not receive support in the server if you use an operating system such as Windows. This is because Linux is the most suitable operating system for bots such as Zeppelin. While it might be possible on OSX or Windows, it is infinitely more difficult and is not as constant as the Linux setup is.

If you are new to Linux and are wondering what distribution to use, I would recommend Ubuntu Server. But almost all distributions should work, provided you follow the steps correctly and switch things that may be specific to your choice of distribution.
